👋 Hey there, I'm Sam Owen (a.k.a. @samjowen or Samuel Owen)!

🔒 I'm passionate about cybersecurity, and my day job revolves around web development with a focus on React.

🚀 In addition, I'm currently learning Rust to expand my programming expertise.

🎲 A game theory enthusiast, I enjoy studying imperfect information games and exploring the strategic aspects they present.

🕵️‍♂️ I'm eager to collaborate on intriguing OSINT projects that can make a positive impact.

😺 Fun fact: I'm a cat lover, which means I'm always ready for a furry friend's company to make coding sessions more enjoyable!
