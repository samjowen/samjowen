👋 Hi there! I'm Sam Owen, also known as @samjowen or Samuel Owen.

🔧 I'm a software engineer from North Wales. My passion for cybersecurity has led me to enjoy completing CTF challenges in my spare time.

🌐 My day job focuses on web development, creating applications using React.

🚀 I'm currently expanding my programming skills by learning Rust. Check out my repos!

♟️ As a game theory enthusiast, I love studying imperfect information games and delving into the strategic intricacies they offer.

🌍 I'm keen on collaborating on innovative OSINT projects that can have a positive impact on society.

😺 Fun fact: I'm a cat lover! Having a furry friend around always makes my coding sessions more enjoyable.
